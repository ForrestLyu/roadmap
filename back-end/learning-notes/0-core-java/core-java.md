> by Cay S. Horstmann
> 11th edition, 2018
## Preface
Java is an extremely solidly engineered language that has gained wide acceptance. Its built-in security and safety features are reassuring both to programmers and to the users of Java programs. Java has built-in support for advanced programming tasks, such as: network programming, database connectivity, and concurrency.

The 11th editon of 'Core Java' is updated to reflect the features of Java Standard Edition (SE) 9, 10 and 11.  
- Object-oriented programming
- Reflection and proxies
- Interfaces and inner classes
- Exception handling
- Generic programming
- The collections framework
- The event listener model
- Graphical user intreface design
- Concurrency

(Volumen II)  
- The Stream API
- File processing and regular expressions
- Databases
- XML processing
- Annotations
- Internationalization
- Netwrok programming
- Advanced UI componentsw
- Native methods

Object-oriented programming (OOP.) is now in the mainstream of programming practice, and Java is an object-oriented programming language.

The two fundamental building blocks of object orientation:  
- Encapsulation: refers to the building of the data with the methods that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct access to some of an object's components.
- Inheritance: lets programmers take an existing class and modify it according to your needs.
