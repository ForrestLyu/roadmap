# Teach yourself programming in ten years

'A little learning is a dangerous thing.' - Alexander Pope

'A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not 
worth knowing.' - Alan Perlis

The disadvantage of learning in such a ruch:  
- Don't have enough time to write several significant programs, and learn from
your successes and failures with them.
- Don't have enough time to work with an experienced programmer and understand
what it is like to live in a C++ environment.
- You're not learning how to program; you're learning to accomplish that tasks.

Here are some advices:  
1. Get interested in programming, and do some because it is fun.
2. Program. The best kind of learning is learning by doing.
3. Talk with other programmers; read other programs.
4. Go to school.
5. Work on projects with other programmers. Be the best programmer on some
projects; be the worst on some others.
6. Work on projects after other programmers.
7. Learn at least a half dozen programming languages.
    - Emphasizes class abstractions: Java, C++
    - Emphasizes functional abstraction: Lisp, ML, Haskell
    - Supports syntactic abstraction: Lisp
    - Support declarative specifications: Prolog, C++ templates
    - Emphasizes parallelism: Clojure, Go
8. Know how long it takes your computer to execute an instruction, fetch a word
from memory (with and without a cache miss), read consecutive words from disk, 
and seek to a new location on disk.
9. Get involved in a language standardization effort.
10. Have the good sense to get off the language standardization effort as
quickly as possible.
